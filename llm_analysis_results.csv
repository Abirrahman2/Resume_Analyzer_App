MD MAHMUDUR RAHMAN.pdf,70,"MD Mahmudur Rahman's resume demonstrates a strong foundation in machine learning and relevant programming languages, showcasing multiple projects involving model development and deployment.  His academic achievements and research experience are impressive. However, the lack of explicit 3+ years of professional experience in a data scientist role and absence of R and SQL expertise are significant drawbacks.  His portfolio and projects highlight practical skills, but the absence of professional experience necessitates further evaluation.","Extensive project portfolio showcasing practical application of machine learning techniques (U-Net, ensemble methods, etc.), Strong programming skills in Python and relevant frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras., Demonstrated experience with model development, evaluation, and deployment., High GPA and Dean's List recognition indicating strong academic performance., Relevant research experience in machine learning (thyroid cancer recurrence, glioma grading)., Competitive programming experience suggesting problem-solving abilities.","Lack of explicit 3+ years of professional experience as a Data Scientist., Absence of R programming language proficiency., Absence of SQL proficiency., Thesis and research projects, while impressive, are not equivalent to full-time professional experience.","Python, machine learning, Data science","R, SQL"
MD MAHMUDUR RAHMAN(Resume).pdf,45,"The candidate possesses a strong academic background with a high CGPA in Computer Science and Engineering and relevant project experience in machine learning.  However, the candidate lacks the required 3+ years of professional experience in a data scientist role and a Master's degree, which are crucial requirements for this position. While the candidate demonstrates proficiency in Python and R, along with experience in machine learning model development, the absence of significant professional experience significantly weakens their candidacy.","High CGPA (3.98/4.0) in Computer Science and Engineering, Demonstrated experience in machine learning model development (Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction), Proficiency in Python and R, Relevant project experience (e.g., Face Recognition System), Dean's List Honors, Participation in competitive programming contests","Lack of 3+ years of professional experience as a Data Scientist, Absence of a Master's degree in a quantitative field, Limited professional experience showcasing data analysis on large datasets","Python, R, machine learning","SQL, Data science"
